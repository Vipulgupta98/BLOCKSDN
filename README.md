# Experiment 1 - Topology Structure of Network

## Goal

This is the network topology structure designed by "parameter".

It should be noticed that I design this network from nowhere... Because I can't find a specific SDN topology structure with three layers in paper. At the same time, because my coding ability is not so good yet, I set few nodes for future debugging. 

2.21 Wellâ€¦ I suddenly come to the fact that why there are only two layers in the original paper: because the slave controllers are only responsible for the transferring of information and nothing else. The meaning of it is just reduce the strain of the network, while the domain controller and super controller are enough for this new kind of network. 

## Problem

If there exits blank in project's name, programm won't be compiled successfully.
